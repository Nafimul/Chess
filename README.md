I made this in my first semester of college, so while it does work and is more advanced than the final project i had to make for school in the second semester, the code does not:
-use best practices for object oriented programming
-have JavaDocs comments
-have unit tests
-use git for keeping track of changes
If I were to make this again today it would be very different.
